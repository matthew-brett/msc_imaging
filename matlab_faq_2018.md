# Frequently asked questions for 2018 Matlab assessment

Feel free to propose edits or new questions for this FAQ.

You can do that by email to <m.brett@bham.ac.uk>, or for cool points, use the
pen icon at the top right of the page to make and propose your edits.  You'll
need a Github account for that, but that's a good thing to have in any case.

## What do you mean "roughly equal chance" of stimulus presentation?

In the assessment document, you will find:

> Each letter in the stimulus set should have a roughly equal chance of being
> presented.

and:

> The order of presentation of the letters should be random, within the
> constraint of 33% targets.

More specifically, the chances of any one stimulus, should be sufficiently
random, that the subject is not aware of any pattern in the stimuli, or that
there are any stimuli that occur more or less often.

You may find yourself running the same subject again, on the same version of
the task.  In that case, a good solution would be to make sure that the
presentation order, for the second presentation, was not the same as the
presentation the first time you present that version of the task.
