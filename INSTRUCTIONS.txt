# Instructions for DS009 replication

In this folder, you will find a copy of the data from the DS009 OpenFMRI
dataset:

https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000009

The version you have here is revision 2.0.3 (see the dataset web page for
details).

The first author of this paper is Jessica Cohen, who is now at the University
of North Carolina:

The web page points you to the methods write-up for the study at:

https://openfmri.org/media/ds000009/ds009_methods_0_CchSZHn.pdf

There is a copy of that document in this folder.

The web page also points you to the canonical write-up of this experiment,
which is Cohen's PhD thesis.  You can get that by following the links on the
page, and logging in through your UoB sign-in, but for your convenience, this
folder has a copy at:

jrcohen_dissertation.pdf

The experiment you have here is the one that Cohen describes in chapter 4 of
her thesis. The chapter title is "The neural basis of self-control"; it is on
page 53 as numbered, page 74 in the PDF.  As far as I can see, the methods
document above is a better-quality reproduction of the methods section in
chapter 4 of the thesis. You will need the thesis chapter for the description
of their FMRI analysis.

Your job is to reproduce the activation maps for the main effects of the four
tasks, as described in figure 4.5 of the thesis chapter, and tables 4.2
through 4.5.

There are four behavioural tasks, and four "main effects".  These are (task /
main effect contrast):

* Stop-Signal (SS) task / successful stop - go;
* Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) / cashing out - inflating the balloon;
* Temporal Discounting (TD) task / difficult trials varying parametrically
  with delay;
* Emotion Regulation (ER) task / activity for "suppress negative" trials
  with positive regression against self-reported regulation.

In order to do this, you should repeat their analysis as exactly as you can.
