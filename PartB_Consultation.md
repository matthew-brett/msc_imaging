# STUDENT CONSULTATION: 
# BRAIN IMAGING PART B ASSESSMENT 

## BACKGROUND

We, your module organizers, have been discussing your module assessment for Part B of the Brain Imaging Fundamentals module. We have two possible module assessments we can run this year. One proposal conforms exactly to the specification and deadlines as published in all the module literature. The other proposal is new. We believe this newer assessment will be a more useful learning exercise for you. However, the details of this are slightly different to those published in the module literature. In order to run this for the entire group, we need your agreement and consent. If you are not happy with the new proposal then we will not run it.


## DETAILS

### Proposal 1
In this assessment you will given a published study to replicate. You will work by yourself. There is a single deadline of Jan 8th 2018. If you make mistakes on this assessment, you will not have any opportunity to correct them. The marked score on your replication will be the sole score for Part B of this module.

### Proposal 2
The new assessment will involve an extra, secondary deadline for the first part of your work on Dec 14th, with the major deadline on Jan 8th 2018 (the currently published deadline). The new assessment would involve you replicating the published study by Dec 14th, and then reviewing another student's replication by Jan 8th 2018, along with **another chance** to fix and resubmit your own replication (now reviewed) and to get **extra marks** for it, by Jan 8th. The score under this proposal will be your a mix of your original replication mark, the mark for the revised replication and the review mark.


## WHY ARE WE SUGGESTING THIS CHANGE?
We think that is a good model of:   
a) learning how to do imaging,   
b) how to write up a study,   
c) learning how to review a study.

For Proposal 1, we ask you to analyze an unpublished study without any review (except by us for marking). For the newer Proposal 2 assessment, we ask you to do this, and then using the feedback you get from looking at someone else's work and by comments you get on your analsysis, to improve your own work. You will also have more interaction with us and your fellow students. 


## QUESTIONS?
If anyone feels strongly that they do not want to be assessed under Proposal 2 then please could you let us know, either in the class or by emailing myself at <p.c.hansen@bham.ac.uk>

thank you
