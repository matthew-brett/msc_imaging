# Replication for DS009 analysis

## Replication steps

Describe here the exact steps that you took in order to replicate the analysis
described in Cohen's thesis.

Remember:

* be clear;
* justify all the analysis steps;

## Replication files

* t-statistic map for main effect of SS task;
* thresholded z-statistic map for main effect of SS task;
* t-statistic map for main effect of BART task;
* thresholded z-statistic map for main effect of BART task;

## Voxels in common across SS and BART

Describe how you generated your image showing voxels in common across the main
effects of the SS and BART tasks.

Point to the location of the image.

## For extra marks

Consider implementing the two-step within-subject registration described in
Cohen's analysis description.

Consider analyzing the TD and ER tasks.
